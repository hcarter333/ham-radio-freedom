A few of the large wedges showed what looked like a calinject line problem in their final test.  It showed up on side 0 (it was exclusively a side 1 issue on the small wedges).

		<td rowspan =2> At first we assumed the problem was the same as the small wedges, the trace had broken in the HDI.  We tried a continuity test between pin 10 (calinject line) and the surface resistor at the end of this line. What we found is that the line was fine.

		<td> While we were trying to locate the 10th pin, we poked several surrounding pins and noticed that this pin seemed shorted to a lot of other pins.  It turned out that the calinject line was shorted to ground.  The likely culprit was the silver epoxy used to connect the ground wire to the backplane.
