function validateUSDate( strValue ) {
/************************************************
DESCRIPTION: Validates that a string contains only
    valid dates with 2 digit month, 2 digit day,
    4 digit year. Date separator can be ., -, or /.
    Uses combination of regular expressions and
    string parsing to validate date.
    Ex. mm/dd/yyyy or mm-dd-yyyy or mm.dd.yyyy

PARAMETERS:
   strValue - String to be tested for validity

RETURNS:
   True if valid, otherwise false.

REMARKS:
   Avoids some of the limitations of the Date.parse()
   method such as the date separator character.
