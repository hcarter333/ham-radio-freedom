The following procedure will be used:
1. Add all code from local storage.
2. Add all code (one file at a time I guess) from the Google App Engine debug console. The process will be time consuming but finite.
3. As each file is added from the debug console, understand and document differences.
4. Maintain a pointer to the latest file that's been added.

There are issues to be aware of:

- The jscript directory appears to be only local.
