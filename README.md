# ham-radio-freedom
This contains the ham radio exam app that can be found at 
[https://hamdaise.wl.r.appspot.com/hamtest](https://hamdaise.wl.r.appspot.com/hamtest)

For the moment, the templatized portions of the exam have been reomoved, so if you'd like you can fork the project to create your own ham practice exams that will run locally, but will not store scores, (you'd need to point the forked code at your own backend storage for that) The application was set up this way so it could be easily debugged (with the exception of stored scores) locally.

The point of this repository for me is to gradually work to make the app easier to maintain.
